# haskell-fp

This repository documents my experiments with pure functional programming in Haskell. I am not a functional programmer
by any means, so this repository will likely be riddled with mistakes, faux pas, etc... apologizes in advance. I will 
draw upon my experience with Racket, and some of the code written here will be translations from UBC's CPSC 110.
